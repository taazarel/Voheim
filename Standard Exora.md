## Systems
### Power Generation
Either through steam or air-propulsion.
- Air-propulsion will only allow the machine to run for a limited time before it has to recharge. The rule is a maximum of 1 hour, with a 5 hour waiting time to charge up fully.
- If running on steam, a Standard Exora can run for as long as there is water in its tank, however. The pilot will need to pour in more water to keep it running. This can be done from inside the cockpit.
### Propulsion
By using its appendages it can run, walk or climb over most obstacles.
### Weapons & Armaments
Swords, guns or crossbows have been manufactured and can be fitted onto the body. 
Armaments are available at an additional fee. Custom orders are prohibitively expensive.
### Armor & Defences
All regulars are equipped with tough armour, strong enough to survive landslides and long falls.
### Communication Tools & Systems
The pilot is able to hear and see outside of the Exora. And can be heard speaking from the outside.
Additional communication systems are available at an additional fee.
### Sensors:
This machinery has no standard sensors.
Additional sensors are available at an additional fee.
### Additional & Auxiliary Systems
Are made to custom order and is not in a formatted list. All expenses are specific to the order, the manufacturer holds the right to deny additional system installations.
### Hangars & Docked Vessels
Are not available for the standard Exora.
## Layout
The pilots seat is reserved for what we have dubbed "The cockpit". Here they can freely control the Exora, exit and enter the machine. 
The core is a small space beneath the shoulders of the machine. It has a openable flap for maintenance. 
Appendages are replaceable and customizable.
