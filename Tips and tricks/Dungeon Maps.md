#tips 

## You love them, we got them
- Maps should show the features and functions of the geography. Spiky walls, treacherous heights, difficult terrain and so on. 
- Anything usefull or nessecary for the players should be visible on the map.
- Remember that most buildings have a specific function which they are specialized for. This will help the design phase and your creativity.
- The map should compliment the tone, goals and theme of the campaign. If you are running a spacethemed campaign but have a feywild building in all your maps, what is happening?
- Options! Players love to be smart. Give them a sandbox and they will suprise you.
- When maps are related to plans remember to give them a second goal besides just combat.
- Remember that maps are a 2D representation of a 3D environment, play with verticallity.
