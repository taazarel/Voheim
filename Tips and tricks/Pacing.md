## The five step method
1. Introduction to plot
1. Journey to plot
1. Discovering plot is not plot
1. Journey to new plot
1. Ending the plot

Each of these steps has 3 markers. Beginning, middle, and end.
Pacing is about controlling when these markers trigger, and how often.
Remember that you can move around the markers in order to establish better pacing. If an enemy you had planned to show up later, just suddenly happens to assault the party before they can find a cure for their friend, now there is suddenly an enticement. The enemy is now missing from a future marker, but you can just add something else.

## The three act method, aka the 121 or 122 method
- Act one
	- Introduction to item/character
	- Introduction to setting
	- Turning point (Point of no return)
- Act two
	- Subplot
	- Love interest
	- Mid-point
	- Planning
	- Execute
- Act three
	- Failure/darkest hour
	- Succes/climax

Pacing is important. If the game is dragging on, you as the dm can make an event to force players to act.

## How to pace a journey:
- In a journey, limit encounters to a maximum of 2. There are multiple kind of encounters: Adversity, conversation and locations. Only give an encounter if it adds to the journey or seeds something for the future.
- Try to not distract from the destination. If an encounter leads away from the road, make sure they quickly get back to it. 
- Engage the senses of the journey. The smell of the grass, sound of water and birds in the trees, the rays of light peeking out from the clouds by dawn.
- Checks and challenges: Made to simulate the environment, not to slow down the players unless it ties into the plot.
- Suprise discoveries: Fantastical moments the players experience during the journey, invoking awe.
