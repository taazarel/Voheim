## How to structure a campaign

Remember the goal of your campaign, Then entice players with events and by refering to their backstory. These events and adventures should tie in to further reach this goal. For Voheim, that would be finding your own identity, and exploring the world.

- The campaign setting: What genre is it? What world? What are the themes and what is the goal of the campaign as a whole?
- Know your players: If the players just want to kill stuff, make them have an adventure all about that. If they like political intruige, do that.
- Use "What if...?" to find out the sentence about the campaing. Aka What the goal is. What if the players are actually helping the bad guy?
- Then develop the "what if...?" scenario by asking: What stories does that allow? (If you cant think of at least 10, maybe rework it)
- Where will you draw inspiration from? What can you look to for further development of your idea?
- What type is the campaign? Epic, Player focused, Open, Episodic, Simulation.
- What is the goal? Why are you running this campaign?
- Why would the players want to join the campaign?
