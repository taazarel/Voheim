## The Goal

There are multiple types of heists. All for different goals.

### Hostage
People. The world does not run without them. Without the people society is just a system.
- Jailbreak 
- One of the party members. 
- An NPC which they like 
- An important person to the current adventure

### Information
Information is power. And Information can be used well as a tool for worldbuilding. Making the players get this information about the world through their actions in a heist could be fun :)

- Lore and history 
- Information about a party-members past 
- Information about the current adventure 
- Information about the enemy 
- Magical knowledge 
- Political information

### Maguffin
Maguffins are not important for what they can do, just that everybody wants them. Thus maguffins can be anything from an item to a place or a person.

### Treasure
Treasures are easy to see why they would be stolen. Usually the motives for such a theft are, money, power, or just to prove themselves.

- Artwork 
- Technology 
- Magical Item 
- Money 
- Deed

## The place
Much more important than the treasure is the place to be infiltrated. This is where most prepwork should go. Attention to detail is important, aswell as weaknesses to exploit and multiple layers of security.

### The Dragon
The **most** important thing in prepping a heist is the dragon. Awakening the dragon can be triggered in a variety of ways. But the dragon should be feared by the players.
If the dragon were to be awoken, the party should be waist-deep in shit. This is the reason for not wanting to get spotted, which will keep them in line from just murdering everyone, since they are magical, and magical people can easily defeat a small army.
*Make sure that the dragon presents a big enough consequence that the players do not want to awake it.*

### The Complication
Everything is going acording to plan, UNTIL, something goes wrong, and the players will have to think quickly on how to get out of the dilemma.

In every heist the complication **must** both: happen at least once, but only once unless the party messes up. And **must** only present a new challenge to overcome, not a definite defeat and immediate consequence.
Some examples are:

- The party is questioned 
- A guard changes behaviour 
- There is an update in the firewall 
- An unknown problem, such as an aditional guard or tripwire shows up.

But all of these **MUST** be able to be overcome with quick thinking.

### The Fortress
A detailed plan of the infiltration area should be made. Along with information about guard schedules, alarms, locked doors and/or additional security.
