From a small village by a lake and lonely mountain, Glaum was born.
One day when Olu's daughter was 14, she journeyed into the jungle.
Niept's daughter became a great druid, who is said to be able to speak with the birds.
Ilsom's lover then became the monarch of a city-state which was named after her own desire.
In the city of the heart of the mountain earthriver birthed many children, not all to the same father.
