From a small village by a lake and lonely mountain, Glaum was born.
One day when Glaum was 14, she journeyed into the jungle.
Glaum became a great druid, who is said to be able to speak with the birds.
She became the king of a city-state which was named after her own desire.
In the city of the heart of the mountain she birthed many children, not all to the same father.
