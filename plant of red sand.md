# Description
Requires attunement
This is a plant of rough bordo colored sand which shifts and slithers though the branches stay still. The sand will float towards the plant if separated by touch.
The plant can be grafted onto armor or shields giving +2 to ac.
If grafted to a helmet or hood the plant will grant the user the ability to breathe underwater and resistance to poison.
It can also be carried in a bag, pot or gourd, in which it will collapse into normal-looking sand.
The user may then pour the sand out as an action, and use its command-word as a reaction until the sand is harvested again as an action
The user may use a reaction on their turn to have the plant:
- Extend up to 10 feet away from its rooted point, to a maximum of 50 feet. and with a carrying capacity of 500-100 pounds.
- Create a 10ft dome which morphs to conceal whatever is inside.
- Begin exhaling a deadly neurotoxin which deals 3d10 psychic damage in a cone of 10ft. This toxin stays in the area until either dispelled by magic or 1 minute has passed.
