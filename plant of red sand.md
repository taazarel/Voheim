# Description
Requires atunement
This is a plant of rough bordo colored sand.
The plant can be grafted onto armor or shields giving +2 to ac.
If grafted to a helmet or hood the plant will grant the user waterbreathing and immunity to poison.
It can also be carried in a bag, pot or gourd, in which it will collapse into normal-looking sand.
The user may then pour the sand out as an action, and use its command-word as a reaction until the sand is harvested again as an action
The user may use a reaction on their turn to have the plant:
- Extend up to 10 feet away from its rooted point, to a maximum of 50 feet.
- Create a 10ft dome which morphs to conceal whatever is inside.
- Begin exhaling a deadly neurotoxin which deals 3d10 psychic damage in a cone of 10ft. This toxin stays in the area until either dispelled by magic or 1 minute has passed.
