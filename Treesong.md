The inhabitants of Ritu uses this ritual spell to build their houses out of living trees. The song forms an idea in the mind of the land, which the trees then fulfill to the benefit of the people.   
As far as ive seen the spell can make a tree as complex or as simple as the singers would like, the only limitation is the dedication of the singers.   
 The kind people were open enough to tell me their ways; they learn these songs as children and are taught the virtues of treesinging, some dedicate themselves entirely to the craft singing every waking hour, from those dedications come the most wonderful and complex of architecture.  
A complex tree takes more time to sing to, the more detail, the more you would need to sing. If you ever do get the chance to learn a tree song, don't pass it up.
