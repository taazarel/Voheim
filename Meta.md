## Notes
When writing notes, write down only the most important parts. 
If there is an item connected to the thing you are writing about, just jot down the name of the connection.
When describing something, use the 5 senses at most, usually 2-3 is enough to make something memorable. Sight, smell, sound, touch and taste.
Notes have to be albe to make sense to YOU specifically
Write down listings in the subject where you will use the item. (A magic sword could be an event or a magic item.)
A good way to keep track of the games history, is to write down what the players do.

### Rewards
Coins, magical items, new abilities, new allies, artifacts or knowledge are all good rewards for players conquests.
Remember to keep the rewards in context of the players powerlevels.
Rarity makes things precious.
Make it specific to your own game.
