"Logo is an owl flying over a mountain"  
The owls of Rock originate from Kö'rum but have made their home in the city of Öbaemnos. Their power consists of pulling the strings of powerful people in the capital, making their agendas come to fruition through subterfuge, the elected council of the republic can easily be manipulated. This is their power, a power which could grow throgh an airship making itself known under their puppet's control.
