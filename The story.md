*Vonën was playing in the woods one day chasing a silver fox when the deity of destruction grew jealous of Aga's library. He descended upon it and destroyed the village when he saw what he had done, he shed a single tear. Vonën returned to the library and met the deity of time, from its halls he got lost and could only get out by finding a golden beetle, but he was too late, the deity of time froze him with the library to save them both, and from its edge he would cry out to the family he had lost. And if you are ever lost in a forest, listen close, you might hear Vonën's cries.*
