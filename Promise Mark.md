A mark carved into the forehead of yourself if you have unfinished business. The mark will also be carved over the heart if it includes bloodshed, thus [[Deathkeepers]] can avoid unnessecary conflict.  
The mark is highly respected and it is considered taboo to mess with, or stop someone in writing the mark. Usually mortal enemies would help each other in writing the mark, if they could not do it themselves.  
A mark may only be written upon the dead or dying, if you are healthy whilst marking yourself, you must commit suicide upon completion.
