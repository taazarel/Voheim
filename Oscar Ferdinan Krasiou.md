### Jarl af Kokkivo Vouno Oscar Ferdinan Krasioú (a.k.a. Jarlen af den blodrøde vin)
Ferdinan grew tired of having to kill the most extraordinary people he met. He began his collection of people when they would rot, he would collect bodyparts from other victims and make a copy of the now rotted corpse. He would also grind their bones, spread the nutrients over his vineyard and name the product of his harvest after the person. He would also serve human flesh to his guests in which he made the food himself, the great cook he is.
