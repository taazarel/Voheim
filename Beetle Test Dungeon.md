## Rooms
### Foyeour
##### Statues
A Circular room with statues of meditating smiling monks, getting older and older as you pass along. In the middle of these statues is a plinth with a groove in the ground around it. 
Should anyone wait for long enough on the plinth it will descend into the room below. It starts descending after a minute and takes a whole day to reach the end.

##### Gate
On the gate into the next room there is an inscription which reads:

*To know what has passed is to know what must follow
To know what must follow is to have the comforbility of waiting (patience)
The comforbility of waiting (Patience) is to accept and excpect the future (Peace)*


### First Room (Adolesence)
There is a statuette of a small child holding out her hands as if to recieve something. She is dirty-looking and behind her is a newly dug mound of dirt where the green tree will be.
In her hands is a small shovel, by digging the last of the dirt from the mound the door will open.
The sky is filled with stars in her room.
