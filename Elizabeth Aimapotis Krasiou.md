##### HISTORY

Ferdinan first met Elizabeth when he was still called "Oscar". At the time of their first meeting ha had just completed the greatest deed of his military career. Though he was poor and she was from a prestigious family, they both found a severe fondness in their relationship. Their love soon blossomed between all odds, the only time of them being together was in feasts and meetings. Ferdinan resolved to win Elizabeth's hand. He began to compete with his fellow soldiers for more renown, he became close friends with high ranking officers and used his political talent in order to rise in the ranks, during this time his significant other profoundly refused any other attempt at marriage. After a decade of hard work, he could finally vouch for the hand of the noble in marriage and was accepted (reluctantly) into the family. Oscar got his new name, title and vineyard where he retired together with his new wife, and a new chapter of his life began.  
The manor life suited Ferdinan much better than combat ever did, he had never liked the concept of war and he wanted the colour of red to symbolise something other than blood. Little did he know, this would be the most gruesome period of his life.  
Elizabeth was, in fact, a cannibal who enjoyed dining on human flesh, she had hired loyal hitmen who prepared meals for her. But this was risky and due to his combat expertise and political inquiry Ferdinan could hide the victims much better, and it was risk-free of rumours. Thusly began their murder-spree together. Their bliss did not last, however, as Elizabeths illness finally took her life, Ferdinan was left to grieve, alone and powerless.
