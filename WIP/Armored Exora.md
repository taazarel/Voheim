# Description
Initially we wanted to create a veritable mountain of a machine. An Exora with defences to exhaust any attack, then strike back.
However this machine has low attack capabilities, simply because it now has a new purpose: protect the commander.

## Systems
### Power Generation
Either through steam or air-propulsion.
- Air-propulsion will only allow the machine to run for a limited time before it has to recharge. The rule is a maximum of 1 hour, with a 5 hour waiting time to charge up fully.
- If running on steam, an Exora can run for as long as there is water in its tank, however. The pilot will need to pour in more water to keep it running. This can be done from inside the cockpit.
### Propulsion
By using its appendages it can run, walk or climb over most obstacles.
### Weapons & Armaments
Swords, guns or crossbows have been manufactured and can be fitted onto the body. 
Armaments are available at an additional fee. Custom orders are prohibitively expensive.
### Armor & Defences
All regulars are equipped with tough armour, strong enough to survive landslides and long falls.
### Communication Tools & Systems
The pilot can see outside thanks to an illusion projected inside. The pilot can hear and be heard from outside when coms are active.
Armored Exora are fitted with a target for magical messages, which extends the range of a message by 1 mile.
Additional communication systems are available at an additional fee.
### Sensors:
This machinery has no standard sensors.
Additional sensors are available at an additional fee.
### Additional & Auxiliary Systems
Are made to custom order and is not in a formatted list. All expenses are specific to the order, the manufacturer holds the right to deny additional system installations.
### Hangars & Docked Vessels
Are not available for the standard Exora.
## Layout
The pilots seat is reserved for what we have dubbed "The cockpit". Here they can freely control the Exora, exit and enter the machine. 
The core is a small space beneath the shoulders of the machine. It has a openable flap for maintenance. 
Appendages are replaceable and customizable.
