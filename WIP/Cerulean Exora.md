### Features
**Hulking mass** Disadvantage on stealth.

**Aquatic Hunter** The Cerulean can only run on steam, but it can refresh its tank while swimming for infinite uptime.
**Glass filament** A glass dome protects the pilot whilst keeping their vision intact. But since the Exora is waterproof the pilot gains disadvantage on perception checks relying on hearing.

## Systems
### Power Generation
If running on steam, a Standard Exora can run for as long as there is water in its tank, however. The pilot will need to pour in more water to keep it running. This can be done from inside the cockpit.
### Propulsion
By using its legs it can walk and run over land, and with its propellers and exhaust systems it can swim and dive in the ocean.
### Weapons & Armaments
Swords, guns or crossbows have been manufactured and can be fitted onto the body. 
Armaments are available at an additional fee. Custom orders are prohibitively expensive.
### Armor & Defences
All regulars are equipped with tough armour, strong enough to survive landslides, long falls and crushing depths.
### Communication Tools & Systems
The pilot is able to see outside of the Exora. And can hear the outside although it is muffled.
Cerulean Exora are fitted with a target for magical messages, which extends the range of a message by 1 mile.
Additional communication systems are available at an additional fee.
### Sensors:
This machinery has no standard sensors.
Additional sensors are available at an additional fee.
### Additional & Auxiliary Systems
Are made to custom order and is not in a formatted list. All expenses are specific to the order, the manufacturer holds the right to deny additional system installations.
### Hangars & Docked Vessels
Are not available for the standard Exora.
## Layout
The pilots seat is reserved for what we have dubbed "The cockpit". Here they can freely control the Exora, exit and enter the machine. 
The core is a small space beneath the shoulders of the machine. It has a openable flap for maintenance. 
Appendages are replaceable.
