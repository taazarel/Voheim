# Description
[[TƒÅbu]]'s own invention. A mechanical scale made of light blue clay, smooth with no ingravings, almost marble in its texture.
Ice cold to the touch, and rings like a singing stone when struck.

### Mechanics & Inner Workings
Place an item on the scales to appraise any truth of it.
If a piece of wood is engraved with the rune for Tabu in one of the cups the person who ingraved it will be rid of lies.
