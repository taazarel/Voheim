#story
Out employer is [[Bidove]]. She was the sponsor of the the first quest. After the succes of it, she invited us to a gala and gave us new clothing.
Cultists with gold markings along their faces started turning into statues but crumbled. They were summoned below deck in the second level of the cargo-hold, with a strange circle of unknown origin, which was opened to an alien location. 
We were asked by [[Zar Johan Valdera]] to be the figurehead of the [[Greev Federation]] and also to explore some ancient ruins. We were offered a monthly salary of 500 gp per person. Acces to the upper society of Athol. And acces to transportation. In turn we have to take on **any** job on the frontier of the new continent.
A new continent has been discovered and is much bigger than the vessel of [[Greev]]. 
In our new mansion we found [[the cultists of circle and triangle]] chanting at our new chatue. After dispatching them, and the abomination they summoned we were at peace.
