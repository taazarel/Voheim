Do what you like to do most

## What makes combat fun?
- Verticality, it is often hard to think in three dimensions on a flat surface, but moving in the third dimension adds much to the experience.
- Environment, use the environment to restrict the combatants. Instead of just making deathboxes, maybe have them fight on the mast of a ship, or on narrow stone pillars above a pit of snakes.
- Alternative win conditions, or the second goal. Usually in combat, both parties have only one objective; kill the opponent. If you instead shift the focus to target another goal, fighting becomes a means to accomplish this, instead of just fighting for its own sake. (Take dead mans chest from pirates of the carribian).
- Lastly, play to the party's strenghts and weaknesses. If one of the players want a 1v1 fight with the big bad, make use of that. Maybe next time the enemy will know of their skill, and at all costs avoid such a situation.

## What to prep
- Have stat-blocks ready to go for different monsters and npc's.
- Have maps ready for different kinds of environments: Town street, camp in the woods, dungeon rooms, tavern and so on.
