"Logo is a snake jutting out of the infertile ground".  
These snakes stick to stealing in broad daylight by pickpockets and information. Their power is supported by assassins and drug dealers in the big city of Öbaemnos. The snakes originate from Kö'tuom. but they are only one of three groups seeking power in the capital. A power which could be uncovered by others or themselves having a big target... say an airship.
