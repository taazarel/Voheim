Eutshé was a noble-born child of Roshu, but despised that hard-work was only for commoners. He abandoned his homeland and began his life of piracy on the coast of Ritu.
After he had proved himself, he became the leader of his own cell, very large by normal standards, and took control of [[Röso]]'s underground.
Currently he is looking to expand into the capital of [[Öbaemnös]] by destroying one of the bands there already.
