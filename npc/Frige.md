### Biography
Her family was always about to fall apart. Her parents argued and shouted around her. Her friends were the only ones to help her in her times of need, always being able to cheer her up. Her best friend [[Ækuf]] was a wimp in his early years but became a huge deal before the trial. Jealousy and rage made her accept [[Oterko]]'s proposal of patronage.  
Now she is on the path to domination and respect of [[Kragvi]].
She killed Ækuf's mother and destroyed his house in fire.
