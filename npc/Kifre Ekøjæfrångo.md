Kifre is the mother of [[Ækuf Ekøjæfrångo]] and the wife to [[Lokruni Ekøjæfrångo]]. She is the responsible one of the household, and always holds a tight line on her unruly husband. Kifre is the one who taught Ækuf about women, and the world, manners and how to behave in general. She was sadly also killed in the fire which engulfed Ækuf's house.
