[[Ækuf Ekøjæfrångo]]'s right hand man.   
Ból is an excellent shot and trusty companion in battle. His wisdom is nothing to scoff at, but his temperament is uncontrollable. His weather changes with the storm, if the weather is dark so is his mood.

>Legs are done for, but his arms can still be used
