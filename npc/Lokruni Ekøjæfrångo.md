#npc 
A sharpwitted sly slithering weasel of a man. His father [[Oterko]] did right to name him after the trickster gods son.   
Although always up for mischief, he is good with a hammer. Many a masterpiece of ships have been created by his hands, and all of [[Råkram]] people loves him.

His legacy is a magnificent ship made in the honour of his son [[Ækuf Ekøjæfrångo]]. 
Yet he is still alive. He tricked his pursuer and went into hiding.
