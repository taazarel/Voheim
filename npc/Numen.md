# Appearance, Personality & Background
also called Kozc, the forgotten 
This god was once a proud diety of a large domain. A domain which is now lost. Countless attempts of resurrection, without avail nor heed to consequences of others has shaped this lost spirit into a wandering guide of others. The ruins of power once possessed by Numen allows them to traverse the world forever bound by immortality. But not a home in sight. May your path to self-discovery be led by the blind. As the blind lead.
