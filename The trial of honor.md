## Description
The trial of honour is a ritual which every 15 year old must complete. It will change according to the choices of the person. The person must choose a way to prove their courage and honour to the family and village. Most just complete it in order to please the family tradition, but some take it more seriously. 
There once was a young man called [[Rofra]] who decided to swim from one great isle to another. A journey that takes many weeks on a boat. But he survived and became a legend.
## History
The trial of honour is derived after the people of [[Kragvi]] were exiled to the harsh lands. The trials are meant to signify adulthood and the journey that must be experienced without supervision. Though now it is more tradition than practical experience.
## Execution
When the young adults depart for their adventure, the mother or father of the family puts on their headband. Looks them in the eyes and whistle or sing a farewell song.
Components and tools
A headband in the family colours. It represents a bond to blood, and a promise to return.
## Participants
Young adults are the ones who participate. They have to be 15 years old. [[HÃ¸vding]] and other villagers watch their departure.
## Observance
The ritual is conducted when the northernmost star shines red at the beginning of the Viking year.
