Chillglass is a transparent crystal with a faint black taint. 
This crystal can absorb heat around itself, although the range and efficiency of this ability change from the size, the cut, the deepness of black, and the [siblings](lore/Blazeglass.md) bond.
Chillglass is harder to move when it is absorbing heat. The more heat the stronger a force needs to be applied in order to move the crystal.
