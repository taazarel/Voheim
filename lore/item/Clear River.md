# Description
A scroll with golden inlays slowly turning into water. It is a tangible flow of a river, but does not make anything wet.
## Statblock
Creates a river of any specification with a maximum width of 50ft and a maximum depth of 20ft with a range of sight. 
The river will not destroy anything which already exists but will merely transform it. The river can be dispelled by dispel magic.
The river will stay until either dispelled, or retracted by finding its source (the end scroll piece) and using it.
It takes 1 minute to use for each mile to grow the river. If less than a mile, it takes an action.
