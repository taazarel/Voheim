### Features
**Hulking mass** Disadvantage on stealth.
**Fill 'er up** Spending a turn will let the pilot fill the tank up to ten percent. (Steam power)
**Blind fighting** The Exoras shielded cockpit protects the pilot from AOE and gives Full cover, but also gives disadvantage on Investigation and Perception Checks.
**Line Breaker** If the lancer has travelled 60ft or more, in the same direction during this turn, add 1d12 + 1d12 per additional 30 ft travelled to the next lance attack.
**Unstoppable** If the lance is mid-charge medium or smaller sized creatures can not force it to stop, but instead become difficult terrain. A creature may use its reaction to step out of the charge, given there is an unoccupied space. 
Creatures who do not avoid the charge take 1d12 + 6 bludgeoning damage.

### Actions
**Eject!** The Exora opens its cockpit letting the pilot escape. 
**Multiattack** The Lancer can make either 2 attacks with punch or 1 attack with lance.
**Punch** 2d12 + 6, 10ft range, proficient.
**Lance** 7d12 + 6, 15ft range, proficient.
**Lance the masses** 4d12 + 6, 15ft line, DEX check 11 + proficiency.

### Bonus Actions
**Charge!** By spending 1 minute of uptime the lancer travels an additional 10ft. You may spend any amount of uptime to a maximum of 30 minutes.

### Reactions

## Systems
### Power Generation
Either through steam or air-propulsion.
- Air-propulsion will only allow the machine to run for a limited time before it has to recharge. The rule is a maximum of 1 hour, with a 5 hour waiting time to charge up fully.
- If running on steam, a Standard Exora can run for as long as there is water in its tank, however. The pilot will need to pour in more water to keep it running. This can be done from inside the cockpit.
### Propulsion
By using its appendages it can run or walk over rough terrain.
### Weapons & Armaments
Swords, guns or crossbows have been manufactured and can be fitted onto the body. 
Armaments are available at an additional fee. Custom orders are prohibitively expensive.
### Armor & Defences
All regulars are equipped with tough armour, strong enough to survive landslides and long falls.
### Communication Tools & Systems
The pilot is able to hear and see outside of the Exora. And can be heard speaking from the outside.
The Lancer is fitted with a target for magical messages, which extends the range of a message by 1 mile.
Additional communication systems are available at an additional fee.
### Sensors:
This machinery has no standard sensors.
Additional sensors are available at an additional fee.
### Additional & Auxiliary Systems
Are made to custom order and is not in a formatted list. All expenses are specific to the order, the manufacturer holds the right to deny additional system installations.
### Hangars & Docked Vessels
Are not available for the standard Exora.
## Layout
The pilots seat is reserved for what we have dubbed "The cockpit". Here they can freely control the Exora, exit and enter the machine. 
The core is a small space beneath the shoulders of the machine. It has a openable flap for maintenance. 
Attached to the core is the main thruster which activates during a charge.
Appendages are replaceable and customizable.
