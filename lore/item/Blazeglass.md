Blazeglass is a red crystal with faint transparent parts.Â  This crystal emanates heat from its core, although the range and efficiency of this ability change from its size, cut, how transparent it is, and the [siblings](Chillglass.md) bond. 
Blazeglass is harder to move when it is in cold environments. The colder it is around it, the more force necessary to move the crystal.
