Magical gloves that remove a spellcasters ability to use the somatic component.  
The gloves can be fastened as an action contested check of sleight of hand or Athletics check against an Acrobatics or Athletics check.  
These gloves are usually used in tandem with [[Rotanu's silencing collar]] to suppress magical deviants.
