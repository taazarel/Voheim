## Description
The black mist decends from the sky, it blackens, rots and makes all live caught in its wake to turn to ash and charcoal. The mist is silent and will snake its way trough the land before sinking into the ground never to be seen again.   
A word of advice for any adventurer; rest on a hilltop... always.  
The origin and intent behind this most deadly of things is a mystery scholars can only speculate, one thing is certain: Mokov is an enemy to all life.

Mokov is a black mist that devours all life in its past.
A weapon created for war, growing out of control of even the deities themselves they quickly banished it to a [far-away place](Shei%20Tan.md).

Some people have begun to worship the thing in their misguided efforts they have brought it back onto [[Lunara]] in small doses.
