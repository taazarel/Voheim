# Description
Also called The scourge.
The spawn of [[Gedhra]] takes many forms due to their high adaptability.
The standard creature has untapped potential, and given 18 hours, will adapt to any challenge that did not kill it.
Growing fins, wings, gills and the capacity to burrow is not uncommon among these creatures. Pray ye never see ones who have adapted to combat with powerful adventurers, like those of [[Shei Tan]].
