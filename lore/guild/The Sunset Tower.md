## Description
A notorious group for stealing the most valuable of treasures.

> When you never know their next target, the natural response is to become paranoid.

Or so ive been told, but those seagulls don't scare me one bit.  
Wanting to expand their dastardly plans, taking to the sky was the next obvious venture, and getting hold of the group able to pilot such a ship in the air, was just what they wanted.

## Structure

The organization consists of small groups of tight-knit thieves, each filling a speciality in order to pull off dangerous stunts. The teams accept each others authority and time spent on heists and as such do not interfere, for they all know that when the chips are down, the only ones they can rely on are each other.

## Culture
Wealth gives you power. Without it freedom is unattainable.

## Public Agenda
Get rich, spit in the face of the established system, and do it with style.

## Assets
This group of thieves always seem to have the completely right tool for the job, along with enough information of recent events to pull of some great heists.

## History
When the trading alliance had accumulated enough wealth to make a class structure on the ilands of Roshu of course there were going to be pirates. But some of those pirates grew hungrier for money and power. So they took to the capitals of Roshu, and spent their time planning the next big hit. Although a relatively new organization 200 years is still enough time to grow.
