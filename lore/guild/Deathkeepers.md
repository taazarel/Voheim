Deathkeepers are a special kind of necromancer whom only exist in [[Sushomela]] 
 They are considered equal to high priests in other lands and their mission is to consolidate unkept promises through the aid of necromancy and [[Promise Mark]]'s
A deathkeeper understands marked promises immediately upon the revival of the body. This means they can accomplish their tasks quickly and efficiently.   
Deathkeepers resurrections wrap the body in white cloth, if non-bloodshed is required, and black if the promise is revenge.
