## Description
A zealous group who keeps checks-and-balances through questions to each other.  
 Their attention was caught when the party acquired their ship. To not have them ruin their plans they sent warnings throughout their ranks.  

### Structure
Any person may ask any other person under them or equal to them a question. If the person under them is asked 5 questions they may ask 1 in return. If the person is more than 1 rank below, they will have to answer 5*n where n is the difference.  
If they are equals you may ask a question but then you will have to answer one.  
  
You are allowed to answer a question even though they have not met the given limit. You are also allowed to stop at 4 questions.

### Public Agenda
To find and use the information for your own gain. To find lost secrets. To find the truth.

### Assets
The top of this organization is very wealthy, thus an enormous amount of gold is fluctuating. The organization has a lot of different small buildings throughout Lunara wherein they scheme.Â   
Dirty work is given to eager bandits for pay.

### History
The Seekers started as a spy organization for the king of a prosperous empire. Alas, when the king fell with his kingdom the seekers were forced to use their acquired information for basic survival. A millennia later the organization is one of the most powerful in the world.
