# Description
Contains the [[Glass Bowl of Aga]]
Is located in a forest of mirrors

### Purpose
Designed to test the delvers for their virtue of focus.
It's purpose is to lead astray, but reward those who have a keen focus.

### Defences
Only those who hold the place in their mind can find it. 

### History
A grove in the forest which has been transformed into a timeless silvery spectre.
This site had a transportation circle which lead into [[Aga Brakksi]]. When the library was frozen in time, the grove was mutated, and its citizens souls trapped within.

### Design
Anyone who wishes to get to the center must first listen to the warning of Glaum. They then must follow a wisp of smoke, which leads to the center, eventually. If they loose concentration on the wisp of smoke, they will step off the path for a brief moment, but it is enough to get the attention of the Hazekillers.

- The grove will try to lure people away from the path, with riches, promises of power and much more.
- The players can gain those riches, however they will be angering 1 hazekiller for each 5 feet they move from the path. 
- For each minute inside the leader must make a concentration check. DC 13. or loose sight of the wisp of smoke for a round. At the start of their next turn, the leader may make a perception check to find the wisp again.
- Each minute a random party member needs to make a wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the whispers. 
- The center is 30 min away from the edge by walking speed (speed of the wisp). When the players reach the glass bowl, the whole grove begins to collapse into the earth. The players will have 10 minutes to escape the grove, if any player fails to do so they will be dragged underground with the hazekillers, who cannot leave the grove.
- Hazekillers who have been alerted will try to stop anyone from fleeing, and they will focus on who is most behind.
