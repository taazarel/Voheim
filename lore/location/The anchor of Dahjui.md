## Description
Some 50 kilometers off the coast of [[Röso]] is a small island. The isle of Dahjui.   
 This island is host to one of the greatest prisons in Ritu, and is named after the dragon who founded the fortress.   
 What lies there now is a depressing hole of a dwarven-made sculpture. A vile contemptuous dungeon, in its bowels filled with the foulest criminals on the continent. But if you sail by its walls, you might just be in time for the demonstration of its power. A cannonade pointed towards the wild sea, in defiance of his temper. Still standing strong, after the war, and after two hundred years of brine and salt.  
 Its warden, a statuary man, and one of great control. Should you go there then remember, be on guard, and be steadfast.  
Their motto is; "By the sea, we stand tall, one force united."

## Purpose / Function

The fortress is a formidable prison, made to keep in the dregs of society. The warden and guards are trained in combat and security.   
 The original purpose however was to fortify the coast of Ritu against outsiders during [[war for a single man]]

## Alterations
The entrances to the towers have been made into checkpoints with barricades, the walls have been rounded with an edge hard to climb over and the sleeping quarters of the army have been made into a prison.

## Architecture
The fortress is made of stone bricks in a beautiful systematic view. Dwarvenmade stonework has held this prison together for centuries. There are four towers one to each cardinal direction with walls in between and minor towers on awkward points. A cannonade is set up towards the southern and western directions, as a memento of its history.   
 The inner buildings have been divided into the prison complex, the housing, the storage, and the barracks.

## History
Founded by a lesser dragon. The dragon's protective runes secure the island. The island was once home to a military fortress but became a prison after a long era of peace.  
The warden of this place is a former bounty hunter who is now retired.
