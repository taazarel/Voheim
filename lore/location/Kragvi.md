# Description
Kragvi is a threefold land. A test of their strength, a punishment for the oath broken, and the preparation to serve again.  
 The land is harsh, and its people harsher. Seabound people are the softest of the Vikings, fishermen, or raiders is the most of their population, the further inland you travel the more you begin to see their training and insane luck in surviving these parts. Tundra Vikings are stealthy, sneaky and sly like foxes. They solve their problems by thinking around them. Most other Vikings call them cowards for their differences, but they still live with more honour than I. Mountainfolk are good at finding passage through dangerous terrain. They use sharp senses to dodge danger, and Timn's own perseverance to survive the cold. The forestfolk are a simple people. Brazen and straightforward, but still quick-witted. Never play "coward" with one of them.
