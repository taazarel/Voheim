Over a lake folds a cliffside above the waters. There is a tower piercing through the cliff mirrored in its surface. That tower seems to shine a metallic silver when the sun hits it from the lake below.
Once, [[Numen]] traveled to the land to help the people against [[Isulae]]. They set a trap for the land and planet. A goblet requiring great sacrifice form whoever drank from it.
The goblet would poison the land and destroy all life if no one took on the great agony. Many tried but the goblet had to be drunk full out.

Numen sacrificed themself by drinking from the goblet, even while their legs turned to dust and their eyes withered away they kept drinking.
The greatest pain being their divinity slowly draining. But alas three drops escaped when Numen fell. 
One fell to the earth and seeped in poisoning the land. 
Another was swiftly drunk by a bird.
And the last eveaporated into the trees leaves and air, killing all who took a breath.

When the deed was done, Numen was carried out on a banner of golden yellow. A thread caugth and unraveled in entrance of the spire. So if you ever find a golden tread upon the jungle floor, you may follow it to the ground of betrayal.

Numen's name was lost, and with it much of their power, but in all tragedies there is hope. The people of [[Ta'ato]] have been searching for the silver dagger, and the three drops of poison.
Should any succeed in bringing them all together under both full moons by the tower, Numens name would once again appear.
