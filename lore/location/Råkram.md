## Description
Råkram is the second-largest city in all of Kragvi. They have it easy most Vikings say. Well I have been there and I say they have it much harder than any not of Kragvi. There are just different standards for "danger" in the rest of the world.

## Geography

A coastal city to the south of the northenmost isle of [[Kragvi]]   
Although the place is shielded from the harshest of winds, the land is still dangerous for non-Vikings.  
Its ragged edge is not made of sand but razor-sharp rocks which will annihilate any who dares come too close. Just like the Vikings want.

### History

[[Mingafr]] once carried a hundred trees from further inland where they are more resilient to the wind, in order to plant a wall. With the new wall the city could grow and eventually Mingafr became chieftan.
