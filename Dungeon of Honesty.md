### Purpose
Originally built as a cruel punishment for terrible criminals, this maze is now used as a proving-grounds for would be saviours of [[Aga Brakksi]]. 
Its traps and denizens are still largely intact, though now some changes have been made.
### Alterations
There is now a sphinx guarding the last level of the maze, it will ask simple questions, and if it does not get a truthful answer, it will attack.
There have also been planted some magical items, and wealth around the maze.
There are now three locks before the last level, each of which require the sacrifice of a specific item, if the correct item is not sacrificed the sphinx will ask why.

### Architecture
Old Stone and woodwork, crudely made and massive in design, the walls are 20 ft tall and 5 ft thick.

### Defenses
Barricades and heavy gates.
### History
The temple was first built by elemental worshippers. The architecture reflects this. Then it was conquered in the last war and damaged heavily on its south side (entrance).
### Entries
The only entry to the maze is from the temple above. The entance is locked behind a large door locked from the outside. The key is hanging above the entrance by a chain.
### Sensory & Appearances
The walls are decorated with serpents and mythical creatures. the further to the center the more detail appears.
A rancid smell of seaweed and moss fills the corridors. The surfaces are damp and cold, no light exists within.
Bringing light inside makes the walls look frozen.
### Special Properties
The walls cannot be destroyed or climbed by normal means.
### Environmental Effects
The walls and floor sometimes shift and become water, it never stays for long, only 1d4+1 rounds.
