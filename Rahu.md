## Description
The people of Ritu are peaceful and harmonious. Every day they sing to the trees and land, they do no harm to the land, trees, and animals but rather perfect their craftsmanship. 
 To outsiders Ritu sounds like a paradise, and to most it is. No conflict, only time to do what you love.
## Naming Traditions
### Family names
Family names have a prefix before the name of the individual, but usually this is only given the first time of meeting.
 
Family names are usually very long with 12 or more syllables.
### Other names
There are such things as outcast names, wherein the named is stripped of their old name and given a meaningless name.
 
They are called nameless and may not be written in Itë, for they hold no meaning.
## Culture
### Average technological level
Rahu technology is mostly made up of writing, pottery, weaving baskets, carving wood, decorating with teeth, and gemstones and pearls, they do not use iron, but instead have found protection through unity.
### Coming of Age Rites
There are multiple traditions depending on which profession you wish to perfect. Singers, historians and warriors are compelled to take part in Amnisa.
Craftsman, priests, watchers and druids will take part in a much larger ritual called Alëmni.
### Common Taboos
Breaking the earth, cleaving up ground for your own gain is considered taboo. By breaking the earth you disturb the land on which you step, the trees roots, and by that the trees under which you sleep, and which gives you food.
Causing discord between two of Nif Ötas Kimë, will surely bring doom upon your people.
### Common Myths and Legends
The Rahu is a traditional people, they not only write down their history but also sing it through rituals.
Many legends and myths are vividly remembered, and one such legend is that of the Mnumusi Öm Maki, and their origins. Others may be myths made up to teach about the world, such as The brown talik, The story of a small village, and How nuts live when we don't see, just to name a few.
On the other end of the spectrum are stories about their own religion, with how Ritu was made, the legend of Lububu of how to live a virtous life and of course the [forgotten song](Numen) which speaks of how to care for the land, the dead and the people.
### Historical figures
Every child knows the legend of [[Lubunu]], a person most important to the growth of Ritu as we know it.
Other than this every village keeps track of its own bloodlines, significance, therefore, varies greatly from place to place.
## Ideals
### Beauty Ideals
Beautiful voices are wanted in Ritu. A good voice carries you a long way in [[Amnisa]], and [[Treesong]]. A symmetrical face shows fine craftmanship when you were born, this is a blessing from the gods. Good posture and dedication to a craft also matter much.
### Gender Ideals
Curiously there is no distinction between genders in Rahu, all follow the same ideals.
### Courtship Ideals
Giving a bead necklace to the person you wish to court is customary. This may only be done after you come of age, but usually, it is done very soon after. 
You may court multiple individuals at a time, regardless of gender and social stature.
When the recipient of the necklace has spent a month debating your offer, they will either decline or accept. 
If the recipient has a guild the guild will try to stop you in undergoing the bonding ritual. Usually, this is done in more a way of fun and pranks rather than actual attempts
### Relationship Ideals
The relationship should be declared again every year at the full moon of both moons preceding the day of marriage.
