## Story Structure
There are some different kinds of adventures.
- Thwarting adventures are all about stopping something, by a straightforward message. Aka kill the enemy, escape the tomb, or so on.
- Delivery adventures are a race to deliver an object to a specific place or person. (every indiana jones movie ever)
- Discovery adventure, find out something, or research it in detail.
- Collection adventure, retrieving an object from an already known location.
Riddle adventures and murder mysteries NEED to be PLANNED OUT. Logical fallicies are NOT TOLERATED in mysteries and riddles.
How to make an adventure event:
- Inciting event: What is the call to action, ala frodo getting a knock on the door by gandalf, and harry getting the letter from hogwarts.
- Events: Random occurrences that intice further adventure and action. also called hooks or seeds. A good idea is to throw out many at the players. These events can be planned or not.
- The effort rule: Events are more memorable if the players work for the plot to happen. Dont just hand them the story on a silver platter, but give them some adversity. Only do this if they bite on the event. This is also helpful for buying time to brainstorm the further plot.
- Get your players to ask/have questions about the event: (Hv-spørsmål er gode)
- Tip the scales: If all players are not completely onboard with investigating the event further, throw in some more curveballs. An assassin tries to kill them for what they know, or they get arrested, or they get sick. (If none are invested, just move on)
- Do not run too many events at once, just one or two. Those two events could also link together to the same plot-point later on, therefore strengthening focus.

## Plans not Plots
There are three different things that can have plans: 
1. People
1. The players
1. The world/universe

People's plans are called plots, they are not plots in the traditional structure sense, but plot as in "evil scheme.
Players will have plans for their characters, although these should not always be followed exactly you can use them as a guide for development.
The universe has natural processes which must be carried out. Aka natural disasters, monsters and so on.
Plans should not be tied to specific dialoge options or spaces. The plan can just be presented wherever you need it to be. 
NPC's plans are adaptable, they need to change to overcome challenge. 

## Adventure Types

### [[Heists]]
Heists are also a cool thing to run. They can be used as a longer adventure, which hold the posibility for all of the adventure types. 
Heists are often good ideas when players have something personal in the balance.

## [[Treasure Hunts]]
Treasure Hunts are very flexible, they can be used to lead the players towards new plot, progression in their character-arcs or just as a fun adventure hunting for lost treasure tied to an aincient legend.

## [[Sieges]]

## [[Battlefields]]

## [[Politics]]

## [[Assassinations]]

## [[Travel]]
